Program written in Java designed to simulate an operating system with these main functions:

  -It is made up of users, disks and printers. Users come in the form of command files and
   are designed to give commands to disks. Disks can save data from the user files which will
   eventually get output to the printers. Printers can only be used by one disk at a time and
   must be released to move onto the next print command

  -The operating system must be able to simulate the runtime of an actual OS, selecting which
   users have access to disks and printers at a given time and ensuring that all users have
   the chance to execute their code before the program exits

  -Utilize java.io.* in order to create buffers, read files and write to them as a simulation
   of what printers and disks would be doing in an operating system.
